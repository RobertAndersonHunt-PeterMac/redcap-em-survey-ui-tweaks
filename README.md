# Survey UI Tweaks

This module provides end users with the ability to apply certain survey tweaks either globally to all surveys in the project or on a survey-by-survey basis.

## Tweaks Included:

1. **Remove Excess TD:** When do don't want to waste the left 1" of the survey, you can turn off 'auto-numbering' of survey questions and enable this tweak.

1. **Hide Submit Button:** In some cases you want a survey to be a 'dead-end'.  Perhaps to display read-only information or to stop an auto-continue chain.  With this tweak you can remove the Submit button from the page.

1. **Hide Queue Corner:** Sometimes you use the survey queue but do not want the button in the upper-right corner to appear on each survey.

1. **Hide Font Resize:** Sometimes you don't want users to see the +/- font resize options

1. **AutoScroll:** Autoscroll is a nifty little add-on that moves the next question to the top of the window after completing any radio/dropdown question.  It is great for mobile surveys where the user doesn't have to scroll with their thumb.  Also, it supports a client-side cookie to remember if a user wants to deactivate the autoscroll feature.

1. **Rename Submit Button:** In some cases, you want to rename the submit button on a survey.  Perhaps to, "Next Section" instead?  This allows you to do just that.

1. **Hide End Queue:** At the end of a survey where the survey queue is enabled, you can HIDE the summary table that shows where someone is on the queue.

1. **Hide Reset Button:** In some cases you want to hide the 'reset link' for radio questions.

1. **Rename "Next Page" Button:** You may want to change the "Next Page >>" language when breaking up a survey by sections.

1. **Hide required field text:** De-clutter your page on surveys with many required fields.
